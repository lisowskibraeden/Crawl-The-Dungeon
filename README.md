#### **Open Source**

I will leave this as an open source game until either I do not wish for it to be on my github or I am proud enough to put this onto some sort of game store
(most likely for free). Any resource is free for the taking (there probably isn't anything worth taking).

I made this for my intro C++ course in university. The structure is a bit better now that I have gone through and updated it, but still not great. As this game really isn't that fun and I have begun work on bigger and better things I will leave this as a little nugget from my past.
